# Description

We are a team consisting of 2 developers, 1 public servant and 1 concerned member of the public. Our team has developed a web app employing the Victorian Governmentâ€™s Vocational Education and Training (VET) dataset and other complementary datasets. It intends to provide a one-stop-shop for finding information about local VET providers.

VET enrolments make up a 69% share of total enrolments in higher education in Victoria in 2014*. The main audience of our web app are young and mid-aged adults trapped in low skill, low paid jobs and want to skill up to improve their future. The audience includes more mature workers who have been retrenched from low skill jobs and need an easily accessible source of information. 

We have a text box in the top left used to search for occupations, course names and providers. Matching providers are displayed in the search results, and when you click on one the map zooms to its location.

The map also displays a number of services that may be useful to those searching for VET courses:
* Learn Local locations, which provide foundational courses
* Department of Health and Human Services office locations, for those needing financial assistance,
* Volunteer resource centre locations that might provide work experience possibilities
* Public internet access locations for study assistance
* Public transport routes, stops and stations
Also included are the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA), which add additional context for policymakers considering place-based vocational project funding.

### Possible enhancements
Filtering to the set of relevant providers
Generating ratings for particular providers
We hope this portal will be a useful resource for those looking to skill up with vocational training, and for employers looking for local education providers.

*231,714 university enrolments in Victoria (excluding enrolments in multi-state higher education institutions; 523,921 VET enrolments in Victoria. Enrolment numbers only include domestic students
